Elmcraft is an unofficial endeavour, curated by a bunch of people who love and use Elm <img width="20" src="/images/elmcraft-heart-transparent.png" />.

Our goal is for Elmcraft to be the _official unofficial_ place for all things Elm.

There is a wealth of knowledge, projects, initiatives and people in the Elm community. Elmcraft is a map to help you find your way.


## Method

Elmcraft.org is a curated set of content using a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) approach.

> Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.

Though we are striving towards a beautiful and well tended garden!


### Markers

Elmcraft uses the following markers on certain content pages to help with context:

- ðŸŒ± **Seedling**: rough and early content, draft or notes
- ðŸª´ **Budding**: content that's mostly cleaned up and clarified
- ðŸŒ³ **Evergreen**: content that's reasonably complete, and tended to over time

If you find a content page without a marker, assume it is a rough draft that's not been tagged yet.

### Katja - Gardener

Katja is a developer with neontribe.co.uk where she mostly makes web apps that aim to improve the reach of small charities. She works iteratively with clients and users to get as close as possible to what people need. Her choice of tools (apart from vim and linux) depends on the project, but she often writes APIs in php and frontends in React (when she has to) and Elm (when she can).

She values community, open source, transparency, integrity, generally sharing stuff and giving everyone a voice. She hopes every day to contribute towards sucking a little bit of despair out of the world and adding a lot of empowerment. In a past life she produced independent films and is a believer that sharing stories makes the world a better place.
