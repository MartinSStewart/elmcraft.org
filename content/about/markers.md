Elmcraft uses the following markers on certain content pages to help with context:

- ğŸŒ± **Seedling**: rough and early content
- ğŸª´ **Budding**: content that's mostly cleaned up and clarified
- ğŸŒ³ **Evergreen**: content that's reasonably complete, and tended to over time

See [about](/about) for more on Elmcraft's method.
