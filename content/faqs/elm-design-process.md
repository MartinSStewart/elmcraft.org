title: Elm's Design Process
description: How the Elm language is designed and developed
---


The Elm language, including compiler, core packages and package manager, are designed and developed by Evan Czaplicki.

Evan has a design process and philosophy around Elm that differs from other open-source projects, and Elm is the way it is today because of this approach<sup>1</sup>.

Elm values _right_ over _right now_,

### History

Evan has written/spoken about the various aspects influencing Elm's design process over the years.

- [Let's be mainstream! User focused design in Elm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE) - Curry On - 2015
- [Costs/Funding in Open-Source Languages](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/costs-funding-in-open-source-languages/5722) - Discourse May 2020
- [The Hard Parts of Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA) - Strangeloop - Sep 2018 – ([transcript, with transcriber's emphasis](https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-hard-parts-of-open-source-by-evan-czaplicki))


These talks are all great in their own right. Here's our humble summary that doesn't do it justice but touches on some main points.


### How to contribute to core

Some people are interested in Elm's design process because they are interested in how to contribute to Elm's core: the compiler, the package manager, and the core `elm/*` packages.


- Outline core development does not work like JS open-source development
- Reference Richard's article on core contribution process
- Reference Evan's articles/examples of good contribution processes
- Reference the "Open source, closed contribution" movement and how other projects are discovering the implicit expectations/demands of OpenSource™ projects
- Reference Evan's video on batching contributions
