The Elm language, including compiler, core packages and package manager, are designed and developed by Evan Czaplicki.

Evan has a design process and philosophy around Elm that differs from other open-source projects, and Elm is the way it is today because of this approach<sup>1</sup>.


> The best way to get started in the community is to participate socially. Maybe that means setting up an ElmBridge event in your area or starting a meetup. Maybe it means helping friends, people at your company, or folks online.
>
> If you already did some of that and want to get involved with code, please check out the following resources:
>
> - What is Success?
> - Code is the Easy Part
> - Building Trust
>
> We have primarily volunteer labor. One full-time dev, but outside of that, it is people working on nights and weekends because it is fun. This makes it hard to get to issues and pull requests as quickly as projects with paid "developer relations" staff to focus specifically on online interactions. So given our goals and resources, we have found that having good working relationships is crucial for collaboration on core code.

> If you are a company evaluating Elm, I encourage you to DM if you are worried about something, and it is totally reasonable to circle back to Elm later!



Elm values _right_ over _right now_.

### History

Evan has written/spoken about the various aspects influencing Elm's design process over the years.

- [Let's be mainstream! User focused design in Elm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE) - Curry On - 2015
- [The Hard Parts of Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA) - Strangeloop - Sep 2018 – ([transcript, with transcriber's emphasis](https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-hard-parts-of-open-source-by-evan-czaplicki))
- [Costs/Funding in Open-Source Languages](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/costs-funding-in-open-source-languages/5722) - Discourse May 2020

These talks are all great in their own right. Here's our humble summary that doesn't do it justice but touches on some main points.


### How to contribute to core

Some people are interested in Elm's design process because they are interested in how to contribute to Elm's core: the compiler, the package manager, and the core `elm/*` packages.

Elm's development process does not work the same as the de-facto expectation some people have of open source.

- The [https://elm-lang.org/community](https://elm-lang.org/community) page outlines some starting thoughts in regards to participation
- [Building Trust: What Has Worked](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/building-trust-what-has-worked/975)
- Reference Evan's articles/examples of good contribution processes
- Reference the "Open source, closed contribution" movement and how other projects are discovering the implicit expectations/demands of OpenSource™ projects
- Reference Evan's video on batching contributions
