# The history of the Elm Slack History question


Every now and then some folks ask the same questions around Slack History and the history of what’s been considered.

This outlines some of the common questions that seem to recur and some of the history around history.

The current status is simply that there is a better place for more permanent discussions: https://discourse.elm-lang.org.



### Why don’t we upgrade to a paid Slack?

For the size of the user base we have, covering the cost for a full license for ~1500 active users a month is not feasible.


### Wouldn’t Elm qualify for the non-profit discount?

Even if the Elm Foundation was eligible to apply for it, and Slack were to award the discount, we’d still be talking about ~$1500 USD / month, which is still not feasible.


### Has anyone reached out to Slack to try negotiate a solution?

Yes, numerous people have tried over the last couple years, including @eeue56 and @supermario most recently.

Despite a long and ongoing conversation with Slack, the final outcome can be summarised in these two email snippets;

> We don’t offer any discounts for open source communities at this time.

> As mentioned, there isn't an alternative we can present right now, but I'll be sure to reach out should I catch wind of any developments in this space.


### Why don’t we do a Patreon / organise a coalition of individual sponsors / corporate sponsor/s / etc?

The Elm Slack community is growing rapidly so the costs are both unknown and rising.

If for any reason the funding stalls for, or even simply falls marginally short one month, we’re flipping back and forth between history and no history.

The combination of these two items warrants the question as to whether the history is worth the hassle and the significant ongoing cost to benefit a small number of very low volume channels, especially given we now have https://discourse.elm-lang.org.


### Why don’t we just switch to something else?

There are close to 15,000 members on Slack now, so a move anywhere is not trivial.

More than 80% of our message traffic is in high volume channels #beginners and #general which don’t particularly benefit from history.


### Okay, but have you considered <some alternative service>?

Lots of other services have been suggested. More suggestions is not going to help switching to some other service.

The migration issue remains regardless of which service it is, which brings the question as to whether history is worth a migration.

Slack seems to work great in most respects and many folks seem to like it just fine. We never see folks suggesting a service move because of Slack functions at large, it only ever seems to recur around the history question.

Any migration potentially just trades off one aspect (it’s annoying I don’t have history) for another set (this isn’t Slack).


### Why don’t we have some service / addon that keeps history?

There were some folks that used to have something setup for this, however Slack T&Cs as well as API changes mean it’s no longer possible to do so.

Since then, some community members (most recently @janiczek and @supermario) started exploring the possibility of a bestpoke hosted slack history archive, but after speaking with Evan they decided to not continue with it – in some ways the continuity of Slack's ephemeral nature is preferred now that we have precedence for it, as it encourages fresh conversation and the movement of interesting information into other formats (Discourse posts, blog posts, etc) which are ultimately better for discoverability in the long run.
