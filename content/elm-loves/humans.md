title: "Elm ❤️ Humans"
description: Discover the joy of reading, writing, thinking and designing in Elm
---


SWBAT:

See that Elm is accessible to all levels of experience & expertise

- You don't need to be clever to use it, but you can use it cleverly
- It was designed to be as easy as possble to write without bugs
- Humans need all the help we can get to stop us making logic errors
- It has a minimal set of functionality to learn
- easy to get started
- composable pieces
- Thoughtful language design, led by strong principles
- Lends itself to diverse teams
- It's not over engineering to use on a small app or prototype
- It's not unweildy to use on a large application

Approach:

- Show syntax is not that different to what use to & few variations
- Illustrate state management - as a one way flow rather than web
- Let Evan speak for himself on language design & feature choices
- Demo helpful error messages & no compile on typo etc
- Refactor joy rather than stress
- Fewer conventions to learn - state pattern, syntax, makes projects more globally approachable [Link to hiring page?]
- Examples from the community of how they have found Elm "easy to use"

What makes Elm such a great match for Humans? For starters, it was designed with us in mind, not for the computer's benefit. Computers are great at processing lots of information. Humans as not. You don't learn Elm, you just use it.

## Error messages

It's easy to make mistakes like these.

[Interactive example with narrative showing common mistakes like typos or mismatched data queries]

## One state management system
It's easier to find where the problem is when you don't have a complex multidirectional web

## Readability and conversations

### Custom types we can express our data models and logic with meaningful words.

[couple of videos - maybe Jono or Joel]

### Encourages to name well & easier to read and review

[Emma naming video]

### Syntax (lack of redundant keywords and extra punctuation)

[Illustration showing lack of noise]

[Interactive example - showing it's not as different to other languages when scratch surface]

### One agreed format, so every project reads the same

 [demo elm format]

## Everything is a function 

Less types of base building blocks, less confusion. Everything returns so you don't have to label with `return` and `function` but you can still read as easily because there is only one kind of stuff.
