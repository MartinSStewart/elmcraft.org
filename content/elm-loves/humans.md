What makes Elm such a great match for Humans? For starters, it was designed with us in mind, not for the computer's benefit. Computers are great at processing lots of information. Humans as not. You don't learn Elm, you just use it.

## Error messages

It's easy to make mistakes like these.

[Interactive example with narrative showing common mistakes like typos or mismatched data queries]

## One state management system
It's easier to find where the problem is when you don't have a complex multidirectional web

## Readability and conversations

### Custom types we can express our data models and logic with meaningful words.

[couple of videos - maybe Jono or Joel]

### Encourages to name well & easier to read and review

[Emma naming video]

### Syntax (lack of redundant keywords and extra punctuation)

[Illustration showing lack of noise]

[Interactive example - showing it's not as different to other languages when scratch surface]

### One agreed format, so every project reads the same

 [demo elm format]

## Everything is a function 

Less types of base building blocks, less confusion. Everything returns so you don't have to label with `return` and `function` but you can still read as easily because there is only one kind of stuff.
