SWBAT:

Understand what the hiring in Elm experience might be like:

- Hiring (actually hiring someone)
- Onboarding (what it's like to actually integrate that person into the team)

Approach:
- "at a glance" points, CTO can skim overview for "shock facts", then go to detail for any claims interesting to them
- social proof against each one with real quotes from people.

Companies using Elm have consistently reported a great experience with hiring for Elm, especially compared to their success in hiring for other languages.

### There are more people excited for an Elm role than there are Elm roles

This means a higher proportion of high quality candidates willing to swap from their current Javascript job because of Elm.

> Wrt. hiring, we are experiencing the Python paradox: the last time I posted a job in the #jobs channel in the Elm Slack, I had about 8 solid applicants reply in the matter of hours/days. From my perspective, people are absolutely eager to work with Elm full-time and we don't have the problem of having to sift through totally junior/beginner candidates.

### Candidates are often more excited to work on Elm than Javascript.

This can be a great differentiation point for your company to attract the best candidates, instead of competing against the huge swathe of Javascript jobs.


### Candidates with Elm experience can usually become productive immediately

Because of Elm’s single architecture, type inference, immutability and purity – all Elm projects have core similarities that allow developers to onboard extremely quickly re-using their existing familiarity.

Candidates don’t have to carefully re-learn “Which combination-flavour of Javascript libraries and architecture does this project use?” – instead they can get going quickly, with the compiler guaranteeing they can’t accidentally cause major damage to existing code.

> ... The best thing about Elm is I am never afraid of breaking the things because of refactoring something, I have complete trust that the compiler will tell me if I did something wrong. This is a huge advantage! Elm gives you a feeling of security and confidence - for new hires this is pretty big deal. You can make big changes and do code cleanups and be confident that everything will be fine. I can’t imagine giving that up. It’s a game-changer for large code bases.

### Candidates without Elm experience can usually become productive in a few days

Companies who’ve hired for Elm have consistently reported that developers without Elm experience could start making meaningful contributions in an Elm codebase much faster than in any other language.

This is mainly thanks to Elm’s architecture and type inference. The Elm compiler acts as a pair programming buddy, preventing most major mistakes and guiding new users along in a friendly way.
