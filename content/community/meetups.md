## Elm Online Meetup

Covid has changed the way the Elm community meets, and the Elm Online Meetup grew out from the Elm London meetups going online.

> Come join us to learn Elm, code and hang out online! Beginners welcome!
>
> Elm Online Meetups generally have a couple lightning talks, followed by a community open mic.
>
> We'll then have some fun with code, as well as just hang out and chat.

See the [upcoming meetups](https://meetdown.app/group/10561/Elm-Online-Meetup).

ðŸ“£ [Elm Online Meetup is always looking for speakers](https://forms.gle/zX4huoLmrLJawn6M7), and would like to particularly encourage first-time speakers and newcomers to the Elm community! The Elm Online Meetup is a friendly and low risk place to practice public speaking.



## Regular Meetups

Many regular Elm meetups were hosted on Meetup.com.

You can find most of them via the [Meetup.com Elm topic](https://www.meetup.com/topics/elm/).
