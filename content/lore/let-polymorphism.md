title: Why does Elm sometimes require defining a function in a let?

One of Elm's key goals is that type signatures are completely optional, and Elm will still infer all your types for you.

<tldr>tl;dr: It would be nice if let and lambda behaved the same but we'd lose some type inference guarantees.</tldr>

Here is an example where that goal can cause type issues:

```elm
usingFunction : (a -> a) -> (Int, String)
usingFunction id = (id 1, id "Hello")
```

This code fails to compile because with the first usage the `a -> a` transforms to `Int -> Int` and then it's incompatible with `String -> String` for the second usage.

But on the other hand, if we wrote:

```elm
usingLet : (Int, String)
usingLet =
  let
    id : a -> a
    id = identity
  in
  (id 1, id "Hello")
```

That compiles because `id 1` and `id "Hello"` each get their own version of `id : a -> a`.

This is more formally known as [let polymorphism in the Hindley Milner type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Let-polymorphism).

As for why this weird distinction happens, it's because if both `let`'s and lambdas had this generalization behaviour, the type system wouldn't be able to always infer all the types<sup>1</sup>, and so you'd sometimes have to provide type annotations.

Currently in Elm you don't ever _need_ to use type annotations.
