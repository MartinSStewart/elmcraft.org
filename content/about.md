Elmcraft is an unofficial endeavour, curated by a bunch of people who love and use Elm <img width="20" src="/images/elmcraft-heart.png" />.

Mario - Mario runs the Elm London meetups, has spoken at Elm Conferences, and is currently working on [Lamdera](https://lamdera.com). He founded Elmcraft to promote and facilitate the wealth of projects, initiatives, knowledge and people in the Elm community.


Katja - Katja is a developer with neontribe.co.uk where she mostly makes web apps that aim to improve the reach of small charities. She works iteratively with clients and users to get as close as possible to what people need. Her choice of tools (apart from vim and linux) depends on the project, but she often writes APIs in php and frontends in React (when she has to) and Elm (when she can). She values community, open source, transparency, integrity, generally sharing stuff and giving everyone a voice. She hopes every day to contribute towards sucking a little bit of despair out of the world and adding a lot of empowerment. In a past life she produced independent films and is a believer that sharing stories makes the world a better place.

In his free time, he loves backpacking and playing the piano. Dillon is also the author of `elm-pages` and a slew of other popular Elm packages!
