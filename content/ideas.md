@TODO how do we do draft pages that don't appear in the final build? Maybe Dillon has an idea :)

Ideas that need a home:

## Learning Elm

### Starting out
- The Elm Guide
- …

### Coming from Javascript

- JS Clean Presentation (Intro to Elm for JS devs)
- …


## "Discover by Area"

Maybe these could be spotlight pages, because certain areas i.e. Gaming have their own microcosm in Elm.

- UI Frameworks
- Gaming
- 3D
- Static sites & SSR
- ...


## Integration guides

- Elm with Javascript
- Elm with TypeScript
- Elm with Node.js
- Elm with Haskell
- Elm on the server

## Lore

- History of Elm
- [Roadmap](/faqs/elm-roadmap) ✅
- Is Elm Dead?
- [Bus Factor](/faqs/bus-factor) ✅
