# Elm for Managers, CTOs and Business owners

These people want to know:

- Who's using it?
- What's the hiring situation like?
- What are the risks in me allowing my team to do this?
- Why shouldn't I pick something popular and "safe" like React/Vue? Everyone is using it aren't they?
- What kind of commercial support is available if things go wrong?
- Benefits of Elm outside of the stuff Developers bang on about
- Will Elm help us make more money? / deliver on time? / deliver faster? / spend less on maintennance?
